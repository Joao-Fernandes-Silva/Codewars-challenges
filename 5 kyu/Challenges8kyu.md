## 5 kyu Challenges

### 1. Convert A Hex String To RGB
- **Description**: When working with color values it can sometimes be useful to extract the individual red, green, and blue (RGB) component values for a color. Implement a function that meets these requirements:

- Accepts a case-insensitive hexadecimal color string as its parameter (ex. "#FF9933" or "#ff9933")
- Returns a Map<String, int> with the structure {r: 255, g: 153, b: 51} where r, g, and b range from 0 through 255

Note: your implementation does not need to support the shorthand form of hexadecimal notation (ie "#FFF")?

- **Examples**:
make_negative(1);  # return -1
make_negative(-5); # return -5
make_negative(0);  # return 0
