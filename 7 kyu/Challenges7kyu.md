## 7 kyu Challenges

### 1. Get the Middle Character
- **Description**: 
- You are going to be given a non-empty string. Your job is to return the middle character(s) of the string.
- If the string's length is odd, return the middle character.
- If the string's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

- **Examples**
"test" --> "es"
"testing" --> "t"
"middle" --> "dd"
"A" --> "A"

### A square of squares
**Description**:
- Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
- In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
- The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

- **Examples**
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false
