## 8 kyu Challenges

### 1. Return Negative
- **Description**: In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Examples
make_negative(1);  # return -1
make_negative(-5); # return -5
make_negative(0);  # return 0


### 2. Max and Min value of a list
- **Description**: Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively. Each function returns one number.

- **Examples**:
* [4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]         -> max = 566, min = -134
* [-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110] -> min = -110, max = 56
* [42, 54, 65, 87, 0]             -> min = 0, max = 87
* [5]                             -> min = 5, max = 5

Notes: You may consider that there will not be any empty arrays/vectors.
